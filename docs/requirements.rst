Requirements
========================

The code assumes that you've already deployed at least one Rubrik Brik into your environment and have completed the initial configuration process to form a cluster. At a minimum, make sure you have installed the following:

1. PowerShell version 4 or higher
2. `PowerCLI`_ version 6.0 or higher
3. `Pester`_ version 3.4.3 or higher
4. (optional) `Windows Management Framework 5.0`_

Note: Although an alpha build of PowerShell exists for Linux and Mac OS environments, the code is currently being written and validated using a Microsoft Windows Server environment.
